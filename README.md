The NYC Citi program has been very successful with subscribers.  Over 80% of the rides (1,900,359 out of 2,344,244) were taken by subscribers compared to single use rides.  The subscriber model appears to be important to the success of the program.  The riders of the NYC Citi program also are majority male (1,530,272 of 2,344,244).

Other key findings include: 

1. The majority of the trips lasted less than one hour. 
2. The length of trip was similar, regardless of gender.
3. Peak demand was between 7 and 9 am and 6 and 8 pm, suggesting riders are using the bikes for commuting. 
4. For some reason, demand was less on Wednesday evenings compared to other weekday demands.
5. The starting locations indicate there is geographic differences.  The highly populated city center had more starting trips than the less populated residential areas. 
6. The single use riders did not have the same gender disparity as the subscriber.  

# Summary

The analysis of NYC Citi provides valuable information for investors wishing to establish a program in other cities.  It will be important to consider the different make up in the users in the new market. The NYC Citi model is heavily dependant on subscribers that appear to be using the bikes for commuting. 
Additional analysis that could be performed on the data include: 

1. Comparison of start and ending points to determine the distance of the rides. 
2. A deeper analysis of user patterns, how many of the users use the bicycles multiple times a week.
